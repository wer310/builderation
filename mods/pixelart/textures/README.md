## Texture file information

The texture files are used in different ways. None of the files are used directly, but are processed before being applied to the nodes.

### pixelart_noise.png

The noise pattern that is applied to the *pixel nodes*. It is colorized with the pixel node’s designated color and then combined with the base texture with the configured or default opacity value.

### pixelart_base.png

All pixel nodes use this texture as the base. The base is colorized with the designated color and then the noise pattern texture is combined with it.

### pixerlart_access_node.png

This is the base texture for the craftable selector access node. The texture is used as base for the access node. It is also overlayed with the noise pattern and and combined with itself using the configured opacity.
